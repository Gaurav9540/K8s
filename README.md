# K8s

**What is Kubernetes ?**

 - Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

 - Developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and released as open-source in 2014.

 - Kubernetes helps manage and organize containers automatically, ensuring that your containers keep running, can scale up when there's more traffic, and can move to healthy machines if something goes wrong.

ðŸš€ **Why Use Kubernetes?**

Imagine you have an app running in a Docker container. Now, imagine you need to run 100 containers across 10 servers, handle failures, scale them up/down, manage load balancing, and update them without downtime. That's where Kubernetes shines.

ðŸ§± **Kubernetes Core Concepts**

1. *Cluster* - Cluster is group of master node and worker node
  - Master Node (Control Plane) â€“ brain of the cluster, manages everything.
  - Worker Nodes â€“ where your containers actually run.
