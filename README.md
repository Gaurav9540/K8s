# K8s

**What is Kubernetes ?**

 - Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

 - Developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and released as open-source in 2014.

 - Kubernetes helps manage and organize containers automatically, ensuring that your containers keep running, can scale up when there's more traffic, and can move to healthy machines if something goes wrong.


ðŸš€ **Why Use Kubernetes?**

Imagine you have an app running in a Docker container. Now, imagine you need to run 100 containers across 10 servers, handle failures, scale them up/down, manage load balancing, and update them without downtime. That's where Kubernetes shines.

ðŸ§± **Kubernetes Core Concepts**

1. *Cluster* - Cluster is group of master node and worker node
  - Master Node (Control Plane) â€“ brain of the cluster, manages everything.
  - Worker Nodes â€“ where your containers actually run.

2. *Pod* - The smallest unit in Kubernetes.
  - A pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers.
  - All containers in a pod share networking and storage.

3. *Node*
 - A physical or virtual machine that runs your applications (pods).
 - Every node has a Kubelet (agent), container runtime (like Docker/Containerd), and Kube-proxy.

4. *Deployment*
 - Manages the desired state for your pods (e.g., number of replicas).
 - Handles updates, rollbacks, and ensures the app stays healthy.

5. *Service* - Provides a stable IP and DNS name to a set of pods. <br>
 *Types:*
   - ClusterIP (default) â€“ for internal communication.
   - NodePort â€“ exposes service on a static port on each node.
   - LoadBalancer â€“ exposes service externally via cloud load balancer.

6. *Namespace*
 - Used to logically separate resources in the same cluster (multi-team or multi-project setup).
